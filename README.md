j86
===

This was an attempt to repackage Java 8 so that it could be used on the Android Platform (where JDK 8 support isn't available yet). [For several reasons](http://shapirord.tumblr.com/post/80539773439/java-8-android-spike), the attempt was unsuccessful, but hopefully someone else might find use of this.

Feel free to clone/fork as you wish - the code is all licensed under GNU GPL (via Oracle).
